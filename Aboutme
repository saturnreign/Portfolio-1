<br>
<p>A little bit about me: I grew up all over the place in a range of different cultures and environments and that has really allowed me to not care too much about what  others think. Through that I have been able to make a lot of decisions that many other teens haven't really gotten to make yet. </p>

<p> Dislikes: Any sort of flying insect or animal, Pessimism, Excessive spiritual expression, The cons of society, Overthinking things</p>

<p>Defining Qualities: Persistence, Logical Reasoning skills, Creativity </p>

<p> Fun Fact: I believe that androgyny is one of the most beautiful things on the planet </p>
